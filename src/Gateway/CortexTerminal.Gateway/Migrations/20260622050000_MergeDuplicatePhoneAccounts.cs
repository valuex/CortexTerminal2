    /// One-off repair: phone_5543 (created 2026-05-06 via phone SMS) and
    /// hw_17701565543 (created 2026-06-22 via Huawei quick-login) are two
    /// separate User rows that belong to the same real person — both bind
    /// phone 17701565543. They were never auto-merged because the
    /// cross-provider phone linkage in EnsureUser is a recent addition.
    ///
    /// The user is currently active on hw_17701565543 (where they reset
    /// the password to test123 today), so we merge phone_5543 → hw_17701565543.
    ///
    /// What this migration does:
    ///   1. Backfill phone_normalized on hw_17701565543's password identity
    ///      so future phone+password logins route to the right account.
    ///   2. Reassign Sessions / Workers / AuditLogs ownership from
    ///      phone_5543 to hw_17701565543 (both have zero rows in practice
    ///      at the time of writing, but the UPDATEs are kept for safety).
    ///   3. Delete phone_5543's identities, then the User row itself.
    ///
    /// Idempotent: if phone_5543 is already gone, every statement no-ops.
